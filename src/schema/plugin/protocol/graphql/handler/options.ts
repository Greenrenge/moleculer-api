filename          string    File name.
mimetype          string    File MIME type. Provided by the client and canâ€™t be trusted.
encoding          string    File stream transfer encoding.
createReadStream  Function  Returns a Node.js readable stream of the file contents, for processing and storing the file. Multiple calls create independent streams. Throws if called after all resolvers have resolved, or after an error has interrupted the request.
